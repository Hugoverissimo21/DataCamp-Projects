    -   Exported transformed DataFrames to CSV files for further use.

2) [Building Financial Reports](https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/DataCamp-Projects/Building%20Financial%20Reports/notebook.html)
  
    -   Utilized Python with pandas and seaborn to analyze financial data from XLSX files.
    -   Calculated key financial ratios (leverage ratio and profitability ratio).
    -   Explored the relationship between leverage and profitability for a specific company type ("real_est") through a scatter plot, finding a positive correlation.
